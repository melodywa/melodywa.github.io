I am a PhD student in Linguistics at Harvard University. My research focuses on the sounds of languages with an emphasis on phonology, which is the study of the abstract underlying representations of sounds. I also touch on morphology, phonetics, prosody, speech sciences and other related disciplines. 


After finishing high school in Oxford, UK, I began my linguistic journey at UCL. Subsequently, I received an MPhil degree at University of Cambridge before my PhD at Harvard. I also had a two-month research internship at CUHK after my second year in college. During my BA and MPhil, I had chances to investigate various phonological questions such as opacity, dissimilation, and locality biases, as well as to carry out phonetic analyses regarding the emotional prosody of Mandarin. 


Beyond my linguistics work, I love reading, football, films, and most importantly -- CATS!!!
