<h2>Research interests</h2>

<p>My research centres around the sound aspect of linguistics, with a greater emphasis on phonology, which studies the underlying representation of human sounds. I am particularly interested in 'opacity'. Some major questions for which I seek answers include:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>How opaque is 'opacity'?</li>
    <l>How learnable is opacity?</li>
    <li>What is the best theoretical framework to account for various types of opacity?</li>
</ul>

<p>Another interest of mine is 'prosody', including both phonological structures and phonetic realisations. On the phonology side, I am interested in metrics (e.g., Chinese poetry and other art forms) and prosody-syntax interface. On the phonetics side, I worked on emotional prosody (e.g., sarcasm). </p>

<p>Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my work or wish to collaborate! </p>
